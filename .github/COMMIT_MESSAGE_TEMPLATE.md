# Hey there o/! 
# 
# We just wanted to let you know that we care a great deal about    
# making our git history clean, maintainable and easy to access for 
# all our contributors. Commit messages are very important to us,  
# which is why we have a strict commit message policy in place.     
# Please use the following guidelines to format all your commit     
# messages:
# 
#     <type>(<scope>): <subject> ( <= 72 char )
#     <EQUAL LINE>
#     <body>
#     <EQUAL LINE>
#     <footer>
# 
# Please note that:
#  - The HEADER is a single line of max. 50 characters that         
#    contains a succinct description of the change. It contains a   
#    type, an optional scope, and a subject
#       + <type> describes the kind of change that this commit is   
#                providing. Allowed types are:
#    feat     (new feature)
#    fix      (bug fix)
#    refactor (refactoring code)
#    style    (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
#    doc      (changes to documentation)
#    test     (adding or refactoring tests; no production code change)
#    version  (version bump/new release; no production code change)

#              patches reasonably sized)
#    defaults (changes default options)
#
#    Note: Multiple tags can be combined, e.g. [fix][#issue_ID] Fix
#          issue brabrabra with methodhandles
#       + <EQUAL LINE> contain 72 "="
#                 "======================================================================="
#       + <scope> can be anything specifying the place of the commit    
#                 change
#       + <subject> is a very short description of the change, in   
#                   the following format:
#             * imperative, present tense: “change” not             
#               “changed”/“changes”
#             * no capitalised first letter
#             * no dot (.) at the end
#  - The BODY should include
#          * the motivation for the change (i.e. explain WHAT, WHY and
#            HOW)
#          * contrast this change with previous behavior
#          * can use multiple lines with "-" or "*" for bullte points
#            in body
#  - The FOOTER should contain
#          * any information about Breaking Changes
#          * also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit
#            closes
